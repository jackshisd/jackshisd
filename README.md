# Biography

I am an Electrical Engineering student at UCLA with a strong focus on embedded systems, circuit design, and hardware prototyping. I am currently working in UCLA’s Emergence of Communication Lab, where I help design and integrate wearable sensing systems for infant research studies, spanning system architecture, PCB design and assembly, and embedded firmware development. I am also a co-author on a paper submitted to ACM CHI 2026 on wearable sensing technology.

Previously, I completed research work at UC San Diego and San Diego State, gaining experience in system-level design, data analysis, and MATLAB-based experimentation. Outside of research, I build end-to-end embedded projects such as Dining Buddy, a custom ESP32-based smart keychain involving PCB design, power management, firmware, and enclosure design, as well as other hardware prototypes and device restorations. I am passionate about developing reliable, user-facing hardware and am actively seeking opportunities in embedded and hardware engineering.
